# Introduction

This paper (Stock Movement Prediction with Financial News using Contextualized Embedding from BERT) explains the development and evaluation of a method for predicting stock market movement using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, particularly focusing on the use of financial news and domain-specific contextual embeddings based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. Below is a summary structured according to the user's request:

# Core Argument

* The paper argues that with the growth of financial news, there is a significant opportunity to use NLP and machine learning for stock movement prediction, which has traditionally been difficult due to the volatile and non-stationary nature of stock prices.
* It emphasizes the development of a Fine-Tuned Contextualized-Embedding Recurrent Neural Network (FT-CE-RNN), leveraging BERT model enhancements for financial domain-specific knowledge, to improve the accuracy of stock movement predictions.

# Evidence

* The authors note that earlier approaches to predicting stock movements were based on classical feature engineering, statistical methods, and the direct application of deep learning to financial news and social media texts. However, these methods faced challenges, such as the lack of domain-specific knowledge and reliance on static embeddings.
* The FT-CE-RNN model outperforms other baseline models in experiments, indicating its efficacy in leveraging contextualized embeddings and domain-specific insights from financial texts for prediction purposes.
* Two trading strategies were simulated to evaluate the model's practical performance further, demonstrating that the model could generate actionable insights for investment decisions with higher annualized returns and Sharpe Ratios compared to baseline models.

# Conclusions

* The FT-CE-RNN model, by utilizing domain-specific enhancements to the BERT model for generating contextualized embeddings from financial texts, represents a state-of-the-art approach for predicting stock movements more accurately.
* The method includes a novel evaluation metric that better reflects investors' interests by focusing on news that significantly moves the market, thus addressing the limitations of previous models that treated all news with equal importance.
* The model's superior performance is validated through experiments that included trading simulations, showing that it not only academically outperforms existing models but also provides practical, actionable insights for investment strategies.
